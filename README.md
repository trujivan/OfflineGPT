## Flask + Vercel

This example shows how to use Flask 3 on Vercel with Serverless Functions using the [Python Runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python).

## Demo

https://flask-python-template.vercel.app/

## How it Works

This example uses the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) with Flask to enable handling requests on Vercel with Serverless Functions.

## Running Locally

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel dev
```

Your Flask application is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Quick Start

![numberText](assets/textGPT.png)

- Start by sending a text message. You will then be presented with an array of options for using the service.
  
![initial](assets/initial.png)

```markdown
> Welcome to OfflineGPT.
> - Text 'Gpt' to use ChatGPT 3.5-turbo to generate a response based on provided text.
> - Text 'Dalle' to use DALL-E to generate an image based on provided text keywords.
> - Text 'Stop' to no more messaging from the service.
```

- If you text 'Gpt', you can make a prompt via SMS and receive a text response.
  - Example:
    - Prompt: 'Gpt How many lemons does a lemon tree produce a year?'
    - Response : 'The number of lemons produced by a lemon tree can vary depending on factors such as the age and health of the tree, the variety of lemon tree, the climate, and the care it receives. On average, a mature lemon tree can produce anywhere from 500 to 600 lemons per year. Some well-cared-for lemon trees have been known to produce even more fruit.'
